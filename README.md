# CustomSet Class
This project implements a CustomSet class in C++. The CustomSet class provides a custom implementation of a set data structure that supports various set operations and operator overloads. This project is a demonstration of my C++ skills and is not part of any coursework.

## Features
- Initialize an empty set, a set with a single value, or a set with a list of values.
- Various member functions to manipulate and query the set.
- Operator overloads for comparison and set operations.
- Functions for set difference, union, and intersection.
- Stream insertion and extraction operators for easy input and output.
## Creation
- This project was created as a demonstration of my C++ skills and understanding of data structures. It is a personal project and is not part of any coursework.
Files
CustomSet.h: Header file containing the declaration of the CustomSet class.
CustomSet.cpp: Source file containing the implementation of the CustomSet class.
main.cpp: Source file containing the main function to demonstrate the usage of the CustomSet class.

## How to Use

1. **Compile the Program**:
   Use your preferred C++ compiler to compile the program. For example, using `g++`:
   ```sh
   g++ -o CustomSet main.cpp CustomSet.cpp
   ./CustomSet
## Here is a sample interaction of the program.
