# CustomSet Class
This project implements a CustomSet class in C++. The CustomSet class provides a custom implementation of a set data structure that supports various set operations and operator overloads. This project is a demonstration of my C++ skills and is not part of any coursework.

## Features
- Initialize an empty set, a set with a single value, or a set with a list of values.
- Various member functions to manipulate and query the set.
- Operator overloads for comparison and set operations.
- Functions for set difference, union, and intersection.
- Stream insertion and extraction operators for easy input and output.
## Creation
- This project was created as a demonstration of my C++ skills and understanding of data structures. It is a personal project and is not part of any coursework.
Files
CustomSet.h: Header file containing the declaration of the CustomSet class.
CustomSet.cpp: Source file containing the implementation of the CustomSet class.
main.cpp: Source file containing the main function to demonstrate the usage of the CustomSet class.

## How to Use

1. **Compile the Program**:
   Use your preferred C++ compiler to compile the program. For example, using `g++`:
   ```sh
   g++ -o CustomSet main.cpp CustomSet.cpp
   ./CustomSet
## Here is a sample output of the program.
Set Manipulation Tool
1. Add a member
2. Remove a member
3. Check if a value is a member
4. Display the set
5. Perform union with another set
6. Perform intersection with another set
7. Perform difference with another set
8. Compare with another set
9. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Enter a value to add: 5
Value added.
